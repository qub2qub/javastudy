12 New Date and Time API (288-273=15)

The DateFormat also comes with its own set of problems. For example, it isn’t thread-safe. This means that if two threads try to parse a date using the same formatter at the same time, you may receive unpredictable results.

Finally, both Date and Calendar are mutable classes. What does it mean to mutate the 18th of March 2014 to the 18th of April? This design choice can lead you into a maintenance nightmare

12.1. LocalDate, LocalTime, Instant, Duration, Period

LocalDate --- An instance of this class is an immutable object representing just a plain date without the time of day. In particular, it doesn’t carry any information about the time zone. 	

LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2014, 3, 18); 
int year = date.getYear(); 
Month month = date.getMonth(); 
int day = date.getDayOfMonth(); 
DayOfWeek dow = date.getDayOfWeek(); 
int len = date.lengthOfMonth(); 
boolean leap = date.isLeapYear();

It’s also possible to obtains the current date from the system clock using the now factory method:
LocalDate today = LocalDate.now();
