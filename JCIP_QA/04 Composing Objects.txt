Encapsulation makes it possible to determine that a class is thread-safe without having to examine the entire program.

The design process for a thread-safe class should include these three basic elements:
•1• Identify the variables that form the object’s state;
•2• Identify the invariants that constrain the state variables;
•3• Establish a policy for managing concurrent access to the object’s state.
