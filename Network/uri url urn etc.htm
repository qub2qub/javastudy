<div class="post-text cye-lm-tag" itemprop="text">
<p class="cye-lm-tag">Uniform Resource Identifier (<code>URI</code>) is a string of characters used to identify a name or a resource on the Internet</p>

<p class="cye-lm-tag">A URI identifies a resource either by location, or a name, or both. <strong>A URI has two specializations known as URL and URN.</strong></p>

<p class="cye-lm-tag">A Uniform Resource Locator (<code>URL</code>) is a subset of the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that specifies where an identified resource is available and the mechanism for retrieving it.URL defines how the resource can be obtained. It does not have to be HTTP URL (http://), a URL can also be (ftp://) or (smb://)</p>

<p class="cye-lm-tag">A Uniform Resource Name (<code>URN</code>) is a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that uses the URN scheme, and <strong class="cye-lm-tag">does not imply availability of the identified resource</strong>. Both URNs (names) and URLs (locators) are URIs, and a particular URI may be both a name and a locator at the same time.</p>

<p class="cye-lm-tag">The URNs are part of a larger Internet information architecture which is composed of URNs, URCs and URLs.</p>

<p class="cye-lm-tag"><strong>bar.html is not a URN</strong>. A URN is similar to a person's name, while a URL is like a street address. The URN defines something's identity, while the URL provides a location. Essentially, "what" vs. "where". A URN has to be of this form <code>&lt;URN&gt; ::= "urn:" &lt;NID&gt; ":" &lt;NSS&gt;</code> where <code>&lt;NID&gt;</code> is the Namespace Identifier, and <code>&lt;NSS&gt;</code> is the Namespace Specific String.</p>

<p class="cye-lm-tag"><strong>To put it differently:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>A URL is a URI that identifies a resource and also provides the means of locating the resource by describing the way to access it</li>
  <li>A URL is a URI</li>
  <li>A URI is not necessarily a URL</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p class="cye-lm-tag">I'd say the only thing left to make it 100% clear would be to have an example of an URI that is not an URL. We can use the examples in the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt" rel="noreferrer">RFC3986</a>:</p>

<pre><code>URL: ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc1808.txt
URL: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt
URL: ldap://[2001:db8::7]/c=GB?objectClass?one
URL: mailto:John.Doe@example.com
URL: news:comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix
URL: telnet://192.0.2.16:80/
URN (not URL): urn:oasis:names:specification:docbook:dtd:xml:4.1.2
URN (not URL): tel:+1-816-555-1212 (?)

<p>Some Camel methods take a parameter that is a <em>URI</em> string. Many people know that a URI is "something like a URL" but do not properly understand the relationship between URI and URL, or indeed its relationship with other acronyms such as IRI and URN.<br clear="none">
Most people are familiar with <em>URLs</em> (uniform resource locators), such as "http://...", "ftp://...", "mailto:...". Put simply, a URL specifies the <em>location</em> of a resource.<br clear="none">
<br><br>
A <em>URI</em> (uniform resource identifier) is a URL <b>or/или</b> a URN.
<br> 
т.е. URI это может быть или URL или URN.
<br> 
So, to fully understand what URI means, you need to first understand what is a URN.<br clear="none">
<br><br>
<em>URN</em> is an acronym for <b>uniform resource name</b>. <br>There are may "unique identifier" schemes in the world, for example, ISBNs (globally unique for books), social security numbers (unique within a country), customer numbers (unique within a company's customers database) and telephone numbers. Each "unique identifier" scheme has its own notation. 
<br>
<u>A URN is a wrapper for different "unique identifier" schemes.</u><br> The syntax of a URN is "<b>urn:&lt;scheme-name&gt;:&lt;unique-identifier&gt;</b>". 
<br><br><b>A URN uniquely identifies a <em>resource</em></b>, such as a book, person or piece of equipment. By itself, a <b>URN <u>does not</u> specify the <em>location</em> of the resource</b>. <br>Instead, it is assumed that a <b><u>registry</b></u> provides a mapping from a resource's URN to its location. <br><br>The URN specification does not state what form a registry takes, but it might be a database, a server application, a wall chart or anything else that is convenient. <br><br>Some hypothetical examples of URNs are "urn:employee:08765245", "urn:customer:uk:3458:hul8" and "urn:foo:0000-0000-9E59-0000-5E-2". The &lt;scheme-name&gt; ("employee", "customer" and "foo" in these examples) part of a URN implicitly defines how to parse and interpret the &lt;unique-identifier&gt; that follows it. <br><br>

An arbitrary URN is meaningless unless: 
<br>(1) you know the semantics implied by the &lt;scheme-name&gt;, and 
<br>(2) you have access to the registry appropriate for the &lt;scheme-name&gt;. <br>
A registry does not have to be public or globally accessible. For example, "urn:employee:08765245" might be meaningful only within a specific company.<br clear="none">
<br><br>
To date, URNs are not (yet) as popular as URLs. For this reason, URI is widely misused as a synonym for URL.<br clear="none">
<br><br>
<b>IRI</b> is an acronym for <b>internationalized resource identifier</b>.<br>
 An IRI is simply an internationalized version of a URI. <br>
  In particular, a URI can contain letters and digits in the US-ASCII character set, while a IRI can contain those same letters and digits, and <em>also</em> European accented characters, Greek letters, Chinese ideograms and so on.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier" rel="noreferrer">URI</a>s identify</strong> and <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator" rel="noreferrer">URL</a>s locate</strong>; however, <strong>locators are also identifiers</strong>, so every URL is also a URI, but there are URIs which are not URLs.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<ul>
<li>Roger Pate</li>
</ul>

<p>This is my name, which is an identifier.
It is like a URI, but cannot be a URL, as it tells you nothing about my location or how to contact me.
In this case it also happens to identify at least 5 other people in the USA alone.</p>

<ul>
<li>4914 West Bay Street, Nassau, Bahamas</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a locator, which is an identifier for that physical location.
It is like both a URL and URI (since all URLs are URIs), and also identifies me <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#indirect-identification" rel="noreferrer">indirectly</a> as "resident of..".
In this case it uniquely identifies me, but that would change if I get a roommate.</p>

<p>I say "like" because these examples do not follow the required syntax.</p>

<h3>Popular confusion</h3>

<p>From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator" rel="noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In computing, a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is a subset of the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that specifies where an identified resource is available and the mechanism for retrieving it. <strong>In popular usage and in many technical documents and verbal discussions it is often incorrectly used as a synonym for URI</strong>, ... [emphasis mine]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because of this common confusion, many products and documentation incorrectly use one term instead of the other, assign their own distinction, or use them synonymously.</p>

<h3>URNs</h3>

<p>My name, Roger Pate, could be like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Name" rel="noreferrer">URN</a> (Uniform Resource Name), except those are <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2135450/why-is-urn-one-of-more-popular-formats-used-to-uniquely-identify-the-resource/3083561#3083561">much more regulated</a> and intended to be unique across <em>both</em> space and time.</p>

<p>Because I currently share this name with other people, it's not globally unique and would not be appropriate as a URN.  However, even if no other family used this name, I'm named after my paternal grandfather, so it still wouldn't be unique across time.  And even if <em>that</em> wasn't the case, the possibility of naming my descendants after me make this unsuitable as a URN.</p>

<p>URNs are different from URLs in this rigid uniqueness constraint, even though they both share the syntax of URIs.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Below I sum up <a href="http://prateekvjoshi.com/2014/02/22/url-vs-uri-vs-urn/" rel="noreferrer">Prateek Joshi's awesome explanation</a>.</p>

<p>The theory:</p>

<ul>
<li>URI (uniform resource identifier) identifies a resource (text document, image file, etc)</li>
<li>URL (uniform resource locator) is a subset of the URIs that include a network location</li>
<li>URN (uniform resource name) is a subset of URIs that include a name within a given space, but no location</li>
</ul>

<p>That is:</p>
